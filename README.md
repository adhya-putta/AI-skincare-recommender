# AI Skincare Recommender

A data analytics project that uses pandas + filtering to recommend skincare products based on input by the user. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and simple recommendation logic.

## Features
- Rule-based recommender
- Data cleaning with pandas
- Visual insights (bar charts, scatterplot)
- Jupyter Notebook with markdown commentary

## Why I Built This Project
I created the AI Skincare Recommender to combine my passion for skincare with my growing skills in data analysis and programming. I wanted to build something practical that could help people find skincare products tailored to their unique skin types and concerns, making the process less overwhelming. This is a really personal project for me as I have struggled with my skin for quite some time now and felt like this was a simple, yet effective solution for many others with the same concerns.

## Challenges I Faced and How I Solved Them
One major challenge was collecting and organizing reliable skincare product data that matched user needs. To tackle this, I researched reputable brands and product ingredients, and built a dataset that balanced variety with quality.

## What I Learned During Development
This project taught me how to integrate user input handling, data processing, and simple AI logic into a cohesive application. I deepened my understanding of Python libraries, project structuring, and version control with Git. Beyond the technical skills, I learned the importance of user experience and clarity in presenting recommendations effectively.
